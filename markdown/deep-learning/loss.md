2. [Focal Loss](#focal-Loss)


## Cross-entropy


## Focal Loss
links - https://leimao.github.io/blog/Focal-Loss-Explained/


Focal loss adds a weighted term onto (the currently used)  cross-entropy loss function which down weights the loss of well classified examples. This should prevent the vast amount of easy negatives from affecting training and allow hard negatives and positives to have more of an effect on the loss.

### TODO

- Maths description

- code implementation, try keep it framework agnostic
