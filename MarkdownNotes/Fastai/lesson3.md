* Note: content starts at 45min *

* **rectified linear unit**(relu )- max(0,sum) in excel

Takes the on the positive unit which gives it the horizontal edges

* max pull

* **tensor** - is an array with more dimensions so we can stack kernals together 

* they are multi dimensional

kernals/filters are being used on multiple the convulsions that are created before it


* **Max Pooling**- using 2 by 2 pooling we would have the resolution

* **Fully connected layer** - sum product of every activation by each weight(using weight matrix). _Don't use these much anymore_


* **Activation function** - eg: softmax. Takes in 1 number spits out another number, nonlinearity **find a better definition**

**Softmax** binary classification (single label)

_insert image of softmax eq_

**Sigmoid** use for multi variable classification(multiple label)

$$s(x)= \frac{e^x}{e^x+1}$$

## Structure of Data

---

* unstructured -all the data is the same thing eg pictures sounds waves

* structured - database type of structure
