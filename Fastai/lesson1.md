# Lesson 1

## Definitions

* **Training Set Loss** - Error from on our training set
* **Validation Loss** -  Error from our validation set
* **Accuracy** - Accuracy of our predections from test set

When we backpropagate we use our training set loss 

If our validation loss is greater then out training loss our model maybe overfitting. 

## Choosing a leraning rate

_lrf_  uses minibatches to find the optimal leraning rate
