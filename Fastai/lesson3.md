* **rectified linear unit**(relu )- max(0,sum) in excel
Takes the on the positive unit which gives it the horizontal edges
* max pull

* **tensor** - is an array with more dimensions so we can stack kernals together 

* they are multi dimenioal

kernals/filters are being used on multiple the convultions that are created before it


* **Max Pooling**- using 2 by 2 pooling we would have the resolution

* **Fully contected layer** - sum product of every activation by each weight(using weight matrix). _Don't use these much anymore_


* **Activation function** - eg: softmax. Takes in 1 number spits out another number, nonlierarity **find a better defintion**

**Softmax** binary classification (single label)

_insert image of softmax eq_

**Sigmoid** use for multi variable classification(multiple label)

$$s(x)= \frac{e^x}{e^x+1}$$

**Structe of Data**
---
* unstructed -all the data is the same thing eg pictures sounds waves

* structured - database type of structure
